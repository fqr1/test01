How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-thanks to the marks 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-Because, if a bug occours, I can get an old version without the bug


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-pros man: u can save critical changes
cons man: maybe u forget to save those changes

pros auto: u don't have to worry about save changes
cons auto: maybe will be saved so many changes


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- would be great to save all the changes in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- with git log and git diff
